# World countries info app

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It's built with Angular 16 and pulls data from the REST Countries API. It stores the last query done by the user and the results returned, as well as the preferred color theme (which can be switched through a toggle) using localStorage.

All icons used in this project were created by Alessio Atzeni, from his [Metrize](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/metrize-icons/) and [Meteocons](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/) icon sets.

A live version of the app can be seen [here](https://rest-countries-api-elyosis.netlify.app/).
