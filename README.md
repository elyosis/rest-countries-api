# World countries info app

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It's built with Angular 16 and pulls data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). It stores the last query done by the user and the results returned, as well as the preferred color theme (which can be switched through a toggle) using localStorage.

All icons used in this project were created by Alessio Atzeni, from his [Metrize](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/metrize-icons/) and [Meteocons](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/) icon sets.

A live version of the app can be seen [here](https://rest-countries-api-elyosis.netlify.app/).
