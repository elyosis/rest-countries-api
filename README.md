# World countries info app

*(Work in progress)*

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). It's built with Angular 16 and pulls data from the REST Countries API.

All icons used in this project were created by Alessio Atzeni, from his [Metrize](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/metrize-icons/) and [Meteocons](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/) icon sets.
